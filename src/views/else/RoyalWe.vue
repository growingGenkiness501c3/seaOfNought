  Art starts conversations.

Salem, Oregon 2017 witnessed a perfect eclipse. The world stopped. The animals quieted. The traffic pulled over. For a brief moment, everyone was doing the same thing.
<br><br>
Somehow, for reasons I don't understand, hate has bloomed in the years since culminating in a global eclipse of reason and hope and the moment has realigned those of us who know better with the need to be vulnerable enough to share our personal stories.
<br><br>
I am on social security for a disability I had spent twenty years accommodating professionally because collaborating with the government was a safe thing to do.
<br><br>
My bleeding disorder, passed along to my triplet adult sons, is of interest to OHSU and my experiences as an medically fragile entrepreneur should be documented not for my needs, but for the needs of future granddaughters who shouldn't have to bleed literally to death while the medications that kept me alive are still available nor should those medications be withheld from humans around the globe yet instead of sharing from our "plenty" we elected to sacrifice medical care for our own instead of sharing with those who will die for the sin of going through puberty.
<br><br>
My story isn't important.
<br><br>
What is important is that others are allowed to share their stories.
<br><br>
Entrepreneurship is all about problem solving and in the early 90s while exceptional at academics, I realized that every seat at the medical school will be filled and lawyers will still find their ways to pass the bar, but my mother had never had a vacation.
<br><br>
My generation watched glass ceilings shattered only for misogynists now to surprise women that we ARE the DEI hire. I have never met someone my age who doesn't have a story about how a man or men limited their potential or took away their feelings of sovereignty.
<br><br>
Critical Race Theory isn't about making white boys feel bad about themselves - if it were, as the mother of triplet sons, I would have noticed. We talked about those Scholastic book fairs that never had a white boys section, but they were also taught that the reason I could run a business and be with them was because I benefited from my grandfather, father, and uncle's privilege. The reason I was ok making the world better "in my lane" or "in my community" was because I knew how exceptional my childhood was and I hope my sons remember to be proud of themselves because they had to struggle through hard times caused by MAGA violence when the police were used to endorse the violence rather than protect children from it.
<br><br>
Unless I find the right help, I will be taking judicial action against the State of Oregon, Kaiser Permanente, and the Church of the Nazarene pro se because MAGA didn't occupy the USA, but they did occupy the GOP and We The People deserve our 1st amendment right to tell the truth about ourselves even when that truth isn't flattering because Mr Rogers promised if it's mentionable it's manageable.
<br><br>
I am on MedicAID and Social Security because my business ended when I reported violence and was labelled "unkind". And when it was my child experiencing the life-threatening child abuse, the fact that the worst anyone could truthfully call me is "unkind" speaks of how well my mother taught me.
<br><br>
Romeo and Juliet isn't a story for children... it's a story for the parents. What warring between adults is worth losing our children?
<br><br>
I am here because I'm willing to look stupid and help you tell YOUR story because the more we empower each other into entrepreneurial efforts, the more problem-solving and the fewer fatalities.
<br><br>
When World War TrumPutin is over, my children will be able to say their mother did "everything she could".
<br><br>
What will you say you did to make things a tiny bit better than you found them?
<br><br>
I want to know how to help you help yourself because doing so helps us all.
